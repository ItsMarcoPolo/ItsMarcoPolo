### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**ItsMarcoPolo/ItsMarcoPolo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning C++. 
- TheCherno C++ Series  [20%]
- learncpp.com          [0,1%]
- MSDN, cplusplus.com / cppreference.com - I guess nothing you will ever finish! Just trying to get used to use these from the beginning.
